## 🧠 What is NGL?

**NGL (Not Gonna Lie)** is a modern anonymous messaging app built for Gen Z.  
It lets people send you **anonymous confessions, questions, or messages**, and you can reply to them publicly.

> **NGL = Not Gonna Lie**  
Because sometimes, you just wanna say something that’s too real to say directly.

## 🎯 Why i Built NGL

Sometimes you wanna:

- Confess to your crush 😳  
- Ask something deep 👀  
- Send a compliment without it being awkward 😌  
- Say what’s on your heart but stay anonymous 🫣  

But you can't always do that in the DMs.

**notGonnaLie** is a space where people can be real without fear of judgment.

## 🤳 How It Works

1. You create a profile and get your own unique link  
   (e.g. `https://notgonnalie.app/yourname`)

2. Share that link on:
   - Instagram bio
   - Snapchat
   - WhatsApp status
   - Anywhere else

3. People send you **anonymous messages** via that link

4. You receive them in the app and can **reply** to them publicly

That’s it. Straightforward and fun.
